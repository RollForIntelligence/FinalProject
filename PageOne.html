  <p>Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.</p>
  <p>However, this mimic was born with a natural intelligence and, after finding its lair as a paperweight in an eccentric archmage's keep, discovered a passion for reading and writing. They adopted the name of Ernest from a silly book they enjoyed and continued to learn in secret.</p>
  <p>Ernest resides today in the abandoned laboratory of that archmage, who perished long ago. The shelves are oddly clear of dust while the floor is strewn with the bones of those who dared try to rob Ernest of their precious tomes. Sustaining themself on the blood of his fallen foes, Ernest has continued to study in the library of the fallen mage.</p>
  <p>Ernest's favorite forms are that of one of several books in the collection and that of a piece of pink coral contained in glass. They are smart enough to be capable of fine-tuning their shapechanging to such an extent that even the words in the book are perfectly accurate.</p>
  <p>Ernest has developed a sort of symbiosis with the archmage's failed experiments, including an enhanced Gelatinous Cube that they can summon from behind the wall across from the hall from the entrance to the library. If Ernest reveals himself to an intruder and the intruder replies with violence, they call for the gelatinous cube to consume their foe. However, due to Ernest's thirst for knowledge, if the intruder instead replies with a kind offer to join him or her on a journey, Ernest will be unable to resist the temptation for new knowledge.</p>

  <p>Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.</p>
  <p><b>Strength in Numbers.</b> Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. The mature quickly and can live to be "great wyrms" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.</p>
  <p><b>Tunnelers and Builders.</b> Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.</p>
  <p><b>The Lost God.</b> In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinked, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.</p>

  <p>Modrons are beings of absolute law that adhere to a hive-like hierarchy. They inhabit the plane of Mechanus and tend its eternally revolving gears, their existence a clockwork routine of perfect order.</p>
  <p><b>Absolute Law and Order.</b> Under the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchical pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego.</p>
  <p>Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet their always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no "I," but only "we" or "us."</p>
  <p><b>Absolute Hierarchy.</b> Modrons communicate only with their own rank and the ranks immediately above and below them. Modrons more than one rank away are either too advanced or too simple to understand.</p>
  <p><b>Cogs of the Great Machine.</b> If a modron is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted modron is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new modron is created by Primus, with a steady stream of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.</p>
  <p><b>The Great Modron March.</b> When the gears of Mechanus complete seventeen cycles once every 289 years, Primus sends a vast army of modrons across the Outer Planes, ostensibly on a reconnaissance mission. The march is long and dangerous, and only a small number of modrons returns to Mechanus</p>
  <p><b>Monodrones.</b> A monodrone can perform one simple task at a time and can relay a message of up to 48 words.</p>

  <p>Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.</p>
  <p><span class="desc">Enemies Of Elemental Evil. </span> In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.</p>
  <p>On the Material Planes, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind--unburdened and ever moving--yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.</p>
  <p>Aarakocra have no concept of political borders or property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and other precious materials means little to aarakocra. In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.</p>
  <p><span class="desc">Search For The Seven Shards. </span> The Wind Dukes of Aaqa come from a race of elemental beings called the vaati, which once ruled many worlds. A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplanar war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty Rod of Law. In a battle against the queen's greatest general, Miska the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Miska by thrusting the rod into him like a spear. The rod shattered into seven shards that scattered across the multiverse. Aarakocra seek signs of the pieces' locations in order to rebuild what is now known as the Rod of Seven Parts.</p>

  <p>The Crystalline Burrowbug gets its name from its iridescent shell of jade beneath quartz. Its digging legs and head bear a distinct resemblance to those of a scarab, while its lower legs and seldomly-seen wings are those of a cicada.</p>
  <p><b>Perfect Disguise.</b> As frail as any bug inside of its shell, the mother burrowbug must find a sufficiently safe location for her initially shell-less offspring's eggs. A prime location is within the hoard of a dragon, where the egg, appearing for all the world as a beautiful amethyst, blends in perfectly. As a sort of instinctual tribute, the infant burrowbug leaves its eggshell--cleanly split in two along its only fault--in the hoard of its temporary guardian.</p>
  <p><b>Mages' Boon.</b> The infant burrowbug, lacking the carapace that gives the creature its name, must create one in the manner that makes this insect a hingepin in the magical ecosystem. The Crystalline Burrowbug's gut is capable of digesting minerals, breaking apart stone and earth into their component parts and keeping them apart. Once it has eaten enough stone, it regurgitates some of its meal and coats itself in the slurry, which swiftly crystallizes into a valuable shell of jade and quartz. The remainder of its meal leaves the body as rough spheres of pure crystal, the nature of which can vary from salt to diamond depending on the materials it consumed.</p>
  <p><b>Prey of the Earth.</b> The beautiful shell and excrement of the Crystalline Burrowbug make it a valuable target for many creatures. Svirfneblin want nothing more than to cultivate them, even the pickiest of Xorn find the taste of Burrowbug on the half-shell delicious, and the titanic Purple Worm consumes this insect as a whale devours krill. As a defense mechanism, the burrowbug has developed a powerful screech that disorients nearby creatures while warning any other nearby Burrowbugs to flee.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. Thw war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves--the drow--found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large--sometimes overwhelming--numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.</p>
  <p><b>Goblinoids.</b> Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.</p>
  <p><b>Malicious Glee.</b> Motivated by greead and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer hoy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.</p>
  <p><b>Leaders and Followers.</b> Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribes survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken overby hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.</p>
  <p><b>Challenging Lairs.</b> Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.</p>
  <p><b>Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.</b> Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.</p>
  <p><b>Worshipers of Maglubiyet.</b> Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.</p>

  <p>From somewhere in the darkness, a gurgling moan is heard. A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.</p>
  <p><b>Dark Servants.</b> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. The move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.</p>
  <p>Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.</p>
  <p>A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.</p>
  <p><b>Hideous Forms.</b> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeding after weeks in the water.</p>
  <p><b>Mindless Soldiers.</b> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops withut hesitation.</p>
  <p>A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.</p>
  <p><b>Undead Nature.</b> A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>

  <p>Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, live far below the world's surface in twisting warrens and sculpted caverns. They survive by virtue of their stealth, cleverness, and tenacity. Their gray skin allows them to blend in with surrounding stonework. They are also surprisingly heavy and strong for their size. An average adult weighs 100 to 120 pounds and stands 3 feet tall.</p>
  <p>A typical svirfneblin enclave contains several hundred deep gnomes and is strongly fortified. Secret tunnels lead to and from the settlement, and the deep gnomes use these as evacuation routes when the enclave comes under attack.</p>
  <p><b>Established Gender Roles.</b> Male svirfneblin are bald, while females have stringy gray hair. Traditionally, females run the enclaves while males scour the outskirts in search of enemies and deposits of precious gemstones.</p>
  <p><b>Gemstone Harvesters.</b> Svirfneblin cherish fine gemstones, especially rubies, which they harvest from mines deep in the Underdark. The hunt for gems often brings them into conflict with beholders, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, and mind flayers. Of all their natural enemies, deep gnomes fear and despise the murderous, demon-worshiping drow the most.</p>
  <p><b>Earth Friends.</b> Deep gnomes are often encountered in the company of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Some svirfneblin can summon such creatures. Earth creatures guard svirfneblin settlements, especially xorn enticed to service with the promise of gems to feed on.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.</p>
  <p><b>Gruumsh One-Eye.</b> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned that they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p>
  <p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p>
  <p><b>Tribes like Plagues.</b> Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, the retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p>
  <p><b>Ranging Scavengers.</b> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p>
  <p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p>
  <p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p>
  <p><b>Leadership and Might.</b> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.</p>
  <p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p>
  <p><b>Orc Crossbreeds.</b> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p>

  <p>Animated bjects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.</p>
  <p><b>Constructed Nature.</b> An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
  <p>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.</p>
  <p><b>Animated Armor.</b> This empty steel shell clamors as it moves, heavy plates banging and grinding against one another like the vengeful spirit of a fallen knight. Ponderous but persistent, this magical guardian is almost always a suit of plate armor.</p>
  <p>To add to its menace, animated armor is frequently enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare suits of animated armor are able to carry on actual conversations.</p>

  <p>A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand-to-hand combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales.</p>
  <p><b>Uncommon Courage.</b> A dragonshield knows that it has a place of honor in the tribe, but--being kobolds at heart--most of them feel unworthy of their status and thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders of their warren.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magice, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor.</p>
  <p><b>Duty-Bound to a Dragon.</b> In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat and mouthpiece--anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to other kobolds on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. The sorcerer is just as awed by and respectful of dragons as common kobolds are, but it knows that its duty requires it not to fawn over its master at all times. It also understands that its frequent proximity to the dragon means it would probably be the first to die if its master became angry or displeased, and so it frantically maintains a balance between adoration and terror in its behavior toward the dragon.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>An ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged insect, its long antennae twitching in response to any movement around it. Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.</p>
  <p><b>Lurkers in the Earth.</b> The ankheg uses its powerful mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.</p>
  <p><b>Bane of Field and Forest.</b> Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting grounds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.</p>
  <p><b>Earthen Tunnels.</b> As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature's attack.</p>

  <p>The druids are often stalwart protectors of nature. They take their duty seriously, though their methods vary wildly based on personality. Generally, druids are benevolent caretakers that are willing to resort to violence if they must to fulfill their duties. Some other dispositions that druids may possess include the following:</p>
  <p><b>Humans are Natural too.</b> These druids believe that the actions of humans are a natural part of nature as well and that attacking them would be paramount to destroying the very territory they defend. Such druids are likely to instead focus on escorting potentially hostile people through their lands so that they do not feel the need to attack, or defending their lands from extraplanar invaders or undead, which are indubitably unnatural.</p>
  <p><b>Preventative Measures.</b> These druids think that the activity of certain races poses a significant threat to the safety of their territory. In order to be proactive about their duties, they begin to exterminate any individuals of those races that they get the opportunity to. Often less than scrupulous, these mages may venture outside of their domain to seek out enclaves to end as revenge for perceived greivances.</p>
  <p><b>Return to Nature.</b> These druids believe that the natural world is either more just, more beautiful, and/or more clean than the refined lands of civilization. They act on this belief, expanding their territory to make more of the world fit their image of a utopia. These mages run the gamut on the morality spectrum, from Good druids who overtake abandoned locations alone to Evil druids who destroy villages in their wake while leaving the fittest to survive.</p>
  <p>Druids are rarely simply called druids. They may be refered to as "Protector of " or "Guardian of " their respective domains. Examples of honorifics that a druid may possess depending on their methods may include "The Wondrous", "The Fierce", "The Inferno", "The Ruthless", and "The Timeless".</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.</p>
  <p><b>Imitative Predators.</b> Mimics can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come in contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods and attacks.</p>
  <p>When it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.</p>
  <p><b>Cunning Hunters.</b> Mimics live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or Undercommon. Such mimics might allow safe passage through their domains or provide useful information in exchange for food.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>A baleful eye peers out from the darkness, its gleam hinting at a weird intelligence and unnerving malevolence. Most times, a nothic is content to watch, weighing and assessing the creatures it encounters. When driven to violence, it uses its horrific gaze to rot the flesh from its enemies' bones.</p>
  <p><b>Cursed Arcanists.</b> Rather than gaining the godlike supremacy they crave, some wizards who devote their lives to unearthing arcane secrets are reduced to creeping, tormented monsters by a dark curse left behind by Vecna, a powerful lich who, in some worlds, has transcended his undead existence to become a god of secrets. Nothics retain no awareness of their former selves, skulking amid the shadows and haunting places rich in magical knowledge, drawn by memories and impulses they can't quite understand.</p>
  <p><b>Dark Oracles.</b> Nothics possess a strange magical insight that allows them to extract knowledge from other creatures. This grants them unique understanding of secret and forbidden lore, which they share for a price. A nothic covets magic items, greedily accepting such gifts from creatures that seek out its knowledge.</p>
  <p><b>Lurkers in Magical Places.</b> Nothics are notorious for infiltrating arcane academies and other places rich in magical learning. They are driven by the vague knowledge that there exists a method to reverse their condition. This isn't a clear sense of purpose, but rather an obsessive tug at the end of the mind. Some nothics are clever enough to realize that this is merely part of the strange lesson for their folly, a false hope to drive them to seek out more arcane secrets.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls.</p>
  <p>The monstrous hook horror has a head resembling a vulture's and the torso of an enormous beetle, with an exoskeleton studded by sharp, bony protuberances. It gains the name from its long, powerfully built arms and legs, which end in wickedly curved hooded claws.</p>
  <p><b>Echoes in the Dark.</b> Hook horrors communicate by striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like random clacking noise is acually a complex language that only hook horrors understand, and which carries for miles through the echoing Underdark.</p>
  <p><b>Pack Predators.</b> The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.</p>
  <p><b>Dedicated Clans.</b> Hook horrors live in extended family groups or clans. Each clan is roled by the eldest female, who typically places her mate in charge of the clan's hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's home caverns.</p>

  <p>In billowing clouds of fog lurk vampiric mists, the wretched remnants of vampires that were prevented from finding rest. Indistinguishable from the mists they lurk within, they strike unseen and undetected to bleed their victims dry.</p>
  <p><b>Former Vampires.</b> Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who couldn't return to their burial places after being defeated or suffering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampires' bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst for blood remains.</p>
  <p><b>Blood Thief.</b> Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze through the creature's pores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue that rains blood droplets wherever it goes.</p>
  <p><b>Attracted to Blood.</b> Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.</p>

  <p><span class="desc">Divine Caretakers. </span> Couatls were created as guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of the divine mandates given to these beings are long since fulfilled or failed. However, a number of couatls still watch over ancient power, await fulfillment of prophecy, or safeguard the heirs of creatures they once guided and protected. Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.</p>
  <p><span class="desc">Truth Tellers. </span> A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.</p>
  <p><span class="desc">Ancient And Few. </span> A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise.</p>
  <p>If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completio;n of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.</p>
  <p>The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>Just as any sailor on the sea must beware the alluring and deadly songs of the harpy, so too must any wanderer who dares traverse the Thunder-Crag Phalanx. There, corruptive elemental energies seep freely into the atmosphere, attracting creatures of the air and of the mountain and transforming them into hideous amalgamations of their former selves. Such has been the lot of a clan of harpies, who have multiplied and covered the mountain range.</p>
  <p>The corruption of the elemental winds has manifested itself in these formerly humanoid creatures, changing their skin into scaly, blue hide, replacing the feathers of their wings with a leathery membrane, and shifting their skull to more closely resemble that of a dragon than that of a human. On their new draconic wings, these intelligent huntresses guard places where the boundaries between the Elemental Chaos and the Material Plane are exceptionally weak, often with the aid of winged kobolds who find their new appearance as attractive as their former ones were famously known to be to humans.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>In hobgoblin society, the Academy of Devastation identifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them through a grueling training regimen that endows them with the ability to call down fireballs and other destructive magic on the host's behalf. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is simultaneously a boon to all its allies and a threat to every foe around it.</p>
  <p><b>Into the Fray.</b> While other cultures treat their wizards as cloistered academics, hobgoblins expect their spellcasters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated through their magic.</p>
  <p>Devastators have the respect of other members of the host, and they receive obedience and deference from many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire formations with a single use of magic allows them to gain far more glory in battle than a single warrior.</p>
  <p>Other cultures might view the use of such abilities as a short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is as valued and useful as a strong sword arm or brilliance in tactics. They are all boons from Maglubiyet that must be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy.</p>
  <p><b>Only Results Matter.</b> Devastators study a simplified form of evocation magic. Their training lacks the theory and context that other folk study, making them skilled in battle but relatively illiterate on the finer points of how and why their magic works.</p>
  <p>The Academy of Devastation believes that an academic approach to magic is a sign of weakness and inefficiency. A warrior doesn't need to know about metallurgy to use a blade, so why should a wizard care about where magic comes from? Devastators love to prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy spellcasters and destroying them.</p>

  <p>When a mind uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the emergence of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon lord's true name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order. The allip acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral creature composed of fragments from the victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony.</p>
  <p><b>Blasphemous secrets.</b> Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but that piece is enough to wrack the recipient with temporary madness. The survivor of an allip's attack are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.</p>
  <p><b>Undead Nature.</b> An allip doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>

  <p>Few creatures that encounter a gorgon live to tell about it. Its body is covered in iron plates, and its nostrils fune with green vapor.</p>
  <p><b>Horrific Structure.</b> A gorgon's iron plates range from steely black to gleaming silver, but this natural armor in no way hinders its movement or mobility. The oils of its body lubricate the armor. A sick or inactive gorgon gathers rust like fungus or mange. When a rusty gorgon moves, its plates squeal as they rub together.</p>
  <p><b>Monstrous Predator.</b> When a gorgon spots potential prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and sends it sprawling, then tramples it to death with its cruel hooves. Faced with multiple foes, the gorgon exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures it touches by turning them to stone. When it grows hungry, it smashes its petrified prey to rubble and uses its strong teeth to grind the stone into a powder that provides nourishment. The crisscrossing network of trampled trails and splintered trees that surrounds a gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its shattered foes.</p>

    The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the revenant's next turn. The revenant's body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

    When the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another humanoid corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.

    Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape DC 14) provided the target is Large or smaller.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="desc">Vengeful Glare. </span>
    The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the end of the revenant's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.

 <section class="Description">
  <p>A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant yses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.</p>
  <p><b>Hunger for Revenge.</b> A revenant has the length of a mortal lifetime to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foes is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.</p>
  <p><b>Divine Justice.</b> No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature dealt the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.</p>
  <p><b>Undead Nature.</b> A revenant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>

  <p>An invisible stalker is an air elemental that has been summoned from its native plane and transformed by powerful magic. Its sole purpose is to hunt down creatures and retrieve objects for its summoner. When it is defeated or the magic that binds it expires, an invisible stalker vanishes in a gust of wind.</p>
  <p><b>Directed Hunter.</b> When an invisible stalker is created, it stays at its summoner's side until it is given a task to perform. If an assignment doesn't involve hunting down and slaying a specific creature or recovering an object, the magic that created the invisible stalker ends and the elemental is released. Otherwise, it completes the task, then returns to its summoner for more commands, forced to serve until the magic that binds it expires. If its summoner dies in the interim, the invisible stalker vanishes after completing its task.</p>
  <p>An invisible stalker is an unwilling servant at best. It resents any undertaking assigned to it. A mission that requires significant time might drive the invisible stalker to pervert the intent of a command unless it is worded carefully.</p>
  <p><b>Unseen Threat.</b> Invisible stalkers are composed of air and are naturally invisible. A creature might hear and feel an invisible stalker in passing, but the elemental remains invisible even when it attacks. A spell that allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the invisible stalker's vague outline.</p>
  <p><b>Elemental Nature.</b> An invisible stalker requires no air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>

  <p><b>Scholar at Heart</b>. All mages of this sort are avid scholars. To reach such a level of magical prowess, a mage must study almost continuously for roughly 8 years. This dedication to the craft, however, means that any who completes this rigorous training is guaranteed to achieve a position of great status in the community and is often the last line of defense for a small settlement under attack.</p>
  <p>These mages must, with very few exceptions, learn their craft from one who has already learnt all the magic they wish to. Historically, this has meant that any aspiring mage must seek out a master that they must then apprentice themselves to. However, in recent years, groups of mages have gathered together to create a system of educational facilities that are easier to access, though individual educations are generally lower in quality.</p>

  <p>Assassins are known for their prodigious skill in stealth and infiltration, as well as their ability to subtlely cause an enemy's death. Most would be charitably described as mercenaries, primarily interested in the exorbitant sums that most clients would be willing to pay for them to use these skills, but others use the money as an excuse to sate their lust for blood in a manner that most politicians wouldn't dare try to punish.</p>
  <p><b>Mercenaries in the Shadows.</b> The majority of assassins fall into this categorization. They do what they do for the sole purpose of acruing wealth, often vast amounts of it. Such assassins rarely have compunctions about who they kill, though some might refuse a client because they believe that someone else would pay more for the same action or they have a sort of code that they won't betray, even for vast amounts of money. The former will usually be involve a high-profile target that is either loved or reviled by the people, while the former often involves killing fellow members of a group or a child. Depending on the players' disposition, they may want to nudge an assassin one way or the other, and knowing why an assassin would refuse a client is a good place to start.</p>
  <p><b>Hunters of Men.</b> Some assassins possess a deep love for the hunt. They take great pleasure in the slaughter of the living as well as the challenge of fighting an intelligent foe. They become assassins because most rulers wouldn't ever make a legitimate attempt to eliminate all assassins from their land; not only would doing so be paramount to painting a giant red target on their back, but they may also wish to utilize the skills of an assassin at a later date. Knowing this, the hunter of men employs himself as an assassin in order to do what he loves. Depending on their individual disposition, such an assassin may kill extra people if they feel they can get away with it or level the playing field for a more exciting hunt. These flaws can be exploited or may be used to enhance the threat.</p>
  <p><b>Noble Aims.</b> The rarest of the assassins, these men and women do not become assassins for the money. They learn these skills so that they may enact vigilante justice against a person who wronged them in some way. These assassins are simultaneously the most and least dangerous, for they won't care about others enough to kill them but they will stop at nothing to kill the source of their vendetta. More often than not mentally unstable in some way, These warriors pursue their target with singleminded determination.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>Frost salamanders are natives of the Plane of Ice, also called the Frostfell, which rests between the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water. Frost salamanders especially like to hunt warm-blooded creatures. They sometimes travel to frigid climes on the Material Plane by wandering through planar gates.</p>
  <p><b>Devourers of Heat.</b> The frost salamanders' aggressive appetite for any heat source leads them to attack settlements they come across. They might mistake the fire of a forge or a campfire for a large, tasty meal, drawing them to attack expeditions and settlements that other predators would avoid. Azers sometimes venture into the Frostfell, where they use large fires to lure frost salamanders into traps to kill them and collect their hides and fangs for use in crafting weapons and armor.</p>
  <p><b>False Refuge.</b> Although frost salamanders can burrow their way through loose soil, they prefer to dig into the ice. They roll around in piles of broken chunks of ice, allowing it to scratch their backs as they grind it down. This habit leads them to create extensive networks of ice caves, becoming ever larger as they claw fresh chunks of ice from the walls of their lairs.</p>
  <p>A frost salamander that dwells in a lair for a while carves out enough space to allow a small army to camp within. Inexperienced travelers who come across these caves see them as a welcome shelter, though they are anything but. Frost salamanders greedily devour any prey foolhardy enough to try sleeping in their lairs.</p>
  <p>On rare occasions, frost giants capture and tame these creatures, using them to burrow into the ice to help create outposts and fortresses.</p>

  <p>This warrior of the house of Dragon-Foes has breached the Underdark accompanied by a force of 50 drow. They have been moving towards the Dwarven Hall of Treasured Past in order to complete their mission to slay its guardian, Kaori Rybrevol, and destroy whatever they can on the interior of the great Hall. Toward this end, Tjener has an Arrow of Silver Dragon Slaying and plans to use it at the earliest certain opportunity.</p>
  <p>Their motions, though under cover of night, are nonetheless as clear as the noontime sun due to the size of the force involved. Keen-eyed druids have spied the Tr&aelig;kke-fjende house crest on the pauldrons of the small army's leadership and warned Kaori that, whatever else they are planning, their first goal is likely to bring about her end. So that she neither leaves the Hall without its guardian nor her daughter without a mother, Kaori is currently biding her time until it is absolutely necessary for her to engage the attacking force.</p>
  <p>Due to the fact that their position is known, the party has a unique opportunity to attack at a time of great advantage; during the day. On the open fields of the Wandering Plains that the force has made camp, there is no space for them to hide from the blinding sunlight. A good thing, too, for a force this size would be far too much to defeat if they were fought at any other time.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>A death kiss is a lesser beholder that might come into being when a beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing blood. Instead of magical eye rays, it has ten long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. In coloration and shape it is similar to the beholder that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted.</p>
  <p><b>Energy Drinkers.</b> A death kiss survives solely by draining energy from other creatures, which it uses to generate electricity inside its body. Paranoid about dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. After it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to scavengers. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride. When underground, it uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all directions. Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch opponents off guard.</p>
  <p><b>False Tyrant.</b> In poor lighting and with its tentacles extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true beholder. It might purposely present itself as a beholder to an ignorant creature, but this behavior is rare, since it usually is focused on hunting and lacks the self-importance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak through any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds nasal and high-pitched. A true beholder has little to fear from a death kiss, since it can easily kill or subdue the death kiss long before the death kiss gets into melee range. Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss usually submits to the rule of a beholder that it encounters, though it might attempt to escape as soon as its master is preoccupied.</p>
  <p><b>Simple Tactics.</b> A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a beholder. It might attempt an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flying up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one or more of its tentacles to a creature and drains energy until its prey collapses. If it is in a superior position and its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its food, slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature.</p>

If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

 <section class="Description">
  <p>The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes are constricted in its coils and eaten alive.</p>
  <p>A behir's monstrous form resembles a combination of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on its underside.</p>
  <p><b>Cavern Predators.</b> Behirs lair in places inaccessible to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a behir ambush. A behir's dozen legs allow it to scramble through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and slithering like a snake.</p>
  <p>Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders in its lair might overlook it.</p>
  <p><b>Foes of the Dragons.</b> In times long forgotten, giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind</p>
  <p>A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if the dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behir back down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.</p>

  <p>Drow shadowblades steal down the darkened passages of the Underdark, bound on errands of mayhem. Ruthless killers, shadowblades find employment with a noble house, usually involving the elimination of a rival in another house. Shadowblades also protect enclaves and Underdark cities from enemies and track down thieves who make off with prized treasures. In whatever role they serve, they move undetected until the moment they attack. And then they are the last thing their victims see.</p>
  <p>A shadowblade harnesses a dark magic that is said to arise from a fiendish ritual in which the drow kills a lesser demon and mystically prevents it from reforming in the Abyss. This ritual creates a shadow demon and infuses the drow with shadow magic.</p>

A pair of the forest's guardians have remarked upon her movements and made the proper authorities aware of them, though they have not yet managed to glean her intentions.</p>
  <p>One of the guardians has been leaving messages in theives' cant at her former campsites directing the party toward her current location from her last known sighting. Once the party begins to get close and rests before the fight, Enke reveals implicitly that she knows that she was being followed and has for some time.

  <p>At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.</p>
  <p><b>Sky Titans.</b> In the ancient days when giants battled dragons for control of the world, Annam, the father of the giant gods, created the rocs so that his worshipers might challenge the dragons' dominance of the air. When the war ended, the rocs were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world.</p>
  <p>Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.</p>
  <p><b>Remote and Alone.</b> Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles. More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.</p>

  <p>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.</p>
  <p><b>Deadly When Summoned.</b> The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attmpt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.</p>
  <p><b>Elemental Nature.</b> An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
  <p><b>Purest Flame.</b> Releasing a phoenix from the Inner Planes creates an explosion of fire that spreads across the sky. An enormous fiery bird forms in the center of the flames and smoke--an elder elemental possessed by a need to burn everything to ash. The phoenix rarely stays in one place for long as it strives to transform the world into an inferno.</p>

  <p>
   <span class="desc">Gust. </span>
    The giant targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates a magical gust of wind around it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in any horizontal direction the giant chooses.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="desc">Thunderbold (2 Actions). </span>
    The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="desc">One With The Storm (3 Actions). </span>
    The giant vanishes, dispersing itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end this effect at the start of any of its turns, becoming a giant once more and appearing in any location it chooses within its lair. While dispersed, the giant can't take any actions other than lair actions, and it can't be targeted by attacks, spells, or other effects. The giant can't use this ability outside its lair, nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a control weather spell or similar magic to quell the storm.

 <section class="Description">
  <p>To forestall the inevitable, some storm giants approaching the end of their natural life spans seek an escape from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undying form of a storm giant clinging to existence.</p>
  <p><b>Elemental Weapons.</b> A storm giant quintessent sheds its armor and weapons, but gains the power to form makeshift weapons out of thin air. When the giant has no further use of them, or when the giant dies, its elemental weapons disappear.</p>
  <p><b>Forsaken Form.</b> A storm giant quintessent can revert to its true giant form on a whim. The change is temporary but can be maintained long enough for the giant to communicate with a mortal, carry out a short task, or defend its home against aggressors.</p>

  <p>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.</p>
  <p><b>Deadly When Summoned.</b> The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attmpt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.</p>
  <p><b>Elemental Nature.</b> An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
  <p><b>Purest Wind.</b> Terrifying storms manifest in the body of the elder tempest. A being carved from clouds, wind, rain, and lightning, the elder tempest assumes the shape of a serpent that slithers through the sky. The tempest drowns the land beneath it with rain and stabs the earth with lances of lightning. Punishing winds scream around it as it flies, feeding the chaos it creates.</p>

 <section class="Description">
  <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelssly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.</p>
  <p>The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
  <p>The scales of a red dragons wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble orbs of molten lava.</p>
  <p><b>Mountain Masters.</b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
  <p><b>Arrogant Tyrants.</b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
  <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
  <p><b>Status and Slaves.</b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they constantly compete for status.</p>
  <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands realty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
  <p><b>Obsessive Collectors.</b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards and legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
  <p>A red dragon knows the value and importance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief isn't found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
